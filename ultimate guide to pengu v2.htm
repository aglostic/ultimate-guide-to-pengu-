<h1>The Ultimate Guide to Pengu (All important links will be provided at the bottom of the page)</h1>
<h2> 👋An Introduction for the Ultimate Guide to Pengu👋</h2>
<p>Some of you may be unaware of what Pengu actually is and why Penguins are crowding this subreddit, as well as other PVPLegacy Communities such as Sponker's Because of this, as the man who began this trend, I have created THE ULTIMATE GUIDE TO PENGU, which explains everything a newbie needs to know about The Cause.

<h2> 🐧What is Pengu? And what does The Pengu Appreciation Club want?🐧</h2>
<p>If we’re talking specifically, Pengu is the name given to a Penguin Build I made and advertised on PVPLegacy’s Discord. Pengu doesn’t come in strictly one form or design, a variety of the ones I made can be seen in the below segment, more so Pengu is a concept which embodies many forms.

<p>Many also tend to use “Pengu” as a slang term for a typical penguin, though given context, it's obvious which we are referring to.

<p>But what about The P.A.C [Penguin Appreciation Club/Cause]? This is a group some of you may have heard off, if I were to grossly oversimplify - it is a Discord Server which acts as the Central Point of Organisation for everything Pengu. The server was originally created by Dragon Warrior, who has become Second in Command for the Movement, and now the server is also run by Rexfury485, xNihilist, and Majorsopa. More information and an invitation to the server can be found further down, however as a group, what do The P.A.C want?

<p>The P.A.C campaigns and demonstrates for the addition of Pengu on one PVPLegacy’s Lobbies, whether OPKitPVP or Duels. To accomplish this, we put on numerous events; which were originally because PVPLegacy Admins such as Eni and AoElite denied the addition of Pengu through negotiation. I will talk about these events far more later, but to say so bluntly, they have universally been considered a success.

<h2>🏗️All builds of Pengu and other Constructions🏗️</h2>
<p>Below is a list, with no links (i cant be asked and will do it later), of every single Pengu Build and their names. This should be the official source for anybody wanting to build Pengu, or any construction similar.

<p>Two Pengus found in a screenshot dating back to August 8th 2017:

<p>Classic Pengu, where it all began

<p>Modern Pengu

<p>Crystal Pengu

<p>Hat Pengu

<p>VL Pengu Model No.1

<p>VL Pengu Model No.2

<p>VL Wall Pengu Model No.3

<h2>On a different subject, I would like to showcase a Fantastic Build Project two Pengu Supporters just happened to do. Taimeless and xNihilist put an astonishing amount of effort into it, so I’d love it if any of you would show support toward them for their deeds!</h2>
<p>(links below)
<h2>🎖️Everything about Pengu Events🎖️</h2>
<p>Here is an Infographic which shows every Pengu Event from 13th February-21st August made by myself.

<p>Some folk have been confused on the terminology used in the Infographic however, so I’d like to clarify some things.

<p>An Incursion is the title we’ve dubbed to a certain type of Pengu Event. Normally weeks in advance, we’ll get the public to vote on a Date and Time, then at the relevant point, we’ll head into a P.A.C VC. In this VC, I’ll explain what the plan is, and afterwards we all head into PVPLegacy’s OPKitPVP wearing unique Penguin Skins. Here’s mine for example.

<p>Since spawns are random, I or perhaps Dragon will decide on a landmark for us all to gather at. Traditionally speaking, this has been The Lavapit. We then put all our efforts into maintaining control over the region, playing music and having some fun. Eventually we’ll move onto the next landmark, and the event will end once we circle back to the Lavapit, jumping in and logging off.

<p>A typical Incursion tends to last 2 Hours~, and it isn’t uncommon for The Admins to pull Hijinks. In Incursion I for example, a UFO was spotted flying over OPKitPVP, and in Incursion IV, the admins totally terraformed the map and spawned in unique mobs!

<p>Incursions are the most popular Pengu Event, however it isn’t all we’ve done, for example on 12/06/2021 we successfully transformed a PVP Map into Antarctica. Occasions like these tend to be far more casual than Incursions, and we plan on doing more of both in the future!

<h2>📚The History and Legacy of Pengu📚</h2>
<p>On the 13th of January 2021, The Pastor of Pengu [Rexfury485], created a simple penguin build and posted an image of it on The PVP Legacy Discord Server on the 14th - followed by a simple caption which read:

<p>“Staff should add this penguin somewhere on the map.” - Rexfury485 14/01/2021

<p>This was the first time Pengu was mentioned, and from here the foundation for The P.A.C’s Objective was founded. To get Pengu onto The VL map.

<p>From there, Pengu attracted people’s attention, and The Pastor made new Penguin builds in different poses. Rexfury was surprised by the connection Vl’s community had with Pengu, and so he began reminding VL Staff daily to construct Pengu somehow/somewhere, in the lobby as per a suggestion.

<p>The movement continued onward for 10 days, however then, PVPLegacy’s Staff Builder: Eni, denounced Pengu claiming:

<p>“You’re not getting any Penguins from me, case closed.” - Eni 24/01/2021

<p>This outraged those devoted to Pengu, and so Dragon Warrior - now The Pastor’s right hand man - known as “The Heart of Pengu”, created a server centred around our favourite Noot Noot Birb. From here, The Pengu Movement grew dramatically, with numerous members joining the cause such as: xNihilist, Medivealheat, Glonk and Majorsopa. These are some of the first individuals to be added to the server. As more people joined, Pengu Officials began plotting how to demonstrate for Pengu’s addition to VL. Thus started The Pengu Incursions.

<p>“We will not be limited to a specific kit, nor a specific place. Pengu supporters are all, and welcoming to all regardless of who they play. The one thing we will all be to spread our message, is a pengu” - Rexfury485 30/01/2021

<p>On the 13th of February 2021, exactly 1 month after Pengu’s creation, Pengu Appreciators united together, and stormed into OP KitPVP with their skins all having one connection. Pengu. The outcome was brilliant, with 13 Players attending, the event itself was an incredible success, with Eni partaking against The Pengu Movement. All participants had fun, and Pengu gained significantly more members, growing in popularity. This pathed the way for VL Veterans like Haphpint and Sythodeus to endorse The Movement’s goal to get Pengu on PVPLegacy’s map. In addition, what is now known as “The First Incursion”, legitimized The Cause and attracted the attention of PVPLegacy’s staff. Eni has talked about Pengu numerous times, while AoElite (Owner of Legacy), joined the P.A.C Server to engage in the discussion of Pengu, and Kaxon joined much earlier to openly approve of Pengu.

<p>Progress through words soon halted, and thus The Pastor and The Heart of Pengu made the decision to do a Second Incursion (20/02/2021), as well as a Third Incursion (28/02/2021) in order to further spread Pengu’s Influence and recruit members to Pengu’s Cause. Results were consistently successful, with key OPKitPVP locations being captured and The P.A.C’s Player Count growing. Incursion I-III shared the trend of a consistent increase of attendees, with Incursion II getting 16 members, and Incursion III getting 22. This so far, is the largest Pengu Event ever.

<p>The P.A.C made many enemies during this time, of which were referred to as “Pengu Haters”, the most notorious of which were Thaash and Kelyplayz. I will dedicate a segment to Pengu’s Enemies later on in this guide. Nonetheless The Pengu Movement endured and remained strong.

<p>After Incursion III, it was decided for Pengu to go on a peaceful path, as such grand events brought hate and toxicity. Therefore The Pastor rebuilt Pengu so as to better contribute to PVPLegacy’s Lobby; these new builds piqued the interest of Current VL Builder Eni, and Retired VL Builder Unstöppable. Ultimately though, this went nowhere, although it should be known VL Staff have hinted at a Pengu Mosaic being added. A sort of Hiatus had begun, and The P.A.C nearly died.

<p>Yet, this is not where Pengu’s Story ends, on 30/05/2021, Rexfury485‘s exams were finished. This meant The Pastor now had time to dedicate to Pengu, and it was this date where he created an Official Logo for The P.A.C. Numerous reforms were made on the discord, with it being totally revamped - and it was also here where documentation of Pengu started. The revival of the server, and its Staff, revived Pengu as a Cause - and from there Events would begin once more.

<p>While events with Lucius_ and a rival Organisation named “Vulpes Ovum '' never amounted to anything [Although I will touch on them later!], on 12/06/2021 Eight Pengu Supporters united to transform a PVPLegacy Map into Antarctica. This event was a breath of fresh air, a grand success, and was showcased in two videos. The first one edited by Microsed, the other by by Penguen482 and Rexfury485

<p>Following this, on 22/07/2021, The P.A.C’s Discord reached 100 Members - which caused celebration. Penguin Documentary “Snow Chick, a Penguin’s Tale”, was streamed in VC with crisp Nitro quality, for the milestone.

<p>Demand for an Incursion Comeback rose, which led Pengu Staff to a unanimous conclusion.

<p>The Incursions were to return. On 31/07/2021 Incursion IV would begin, except with the biggest twist any Pengu Event had, and has, ever seen. Dragon felt that after such a long break, this Incursion would need momentum, and so he talked with Kaxon to pull a stunt of sorts. He arranged for the Admins to make OPKitPVP suddenly snow during the Incursion, and at random times spawn three variants of unique mobs in mass. These were Buffed Polar Bears, Buffed Killer Rabbits, and Buffed Stray - all of which certainly made Incursion IV absolutely remarkable. To my knowledge, an event like this in OPKitPVP has never occurred before, at least to this scale.

<p>Three weeks later, on 21/08/2021, we organised Incursion V - which just like Incursion IV had 18 participants. The event was far more casual than the last one, but interestingly did see some strong opposition, giving our players quite the challenge. Nonetheless, as always, Pengu Triumphed.

<p>That has been the most recent Pengu Event, and with The P.A.C being stronger than ever, it certainly won’t be the last. I promise you, one day, however far it may be - I will be able to document Pengu’s Addition onto PVPLegacy. We will take whatever means necessary in order for our Birb to get in, he’s a good Pengu after all!

<p>“This wouldn't have happened without all of you wonderful people, I'm extraordinarily grateful this was actually able to happen, and I'm glad it's all done in good spirit!” - Rexfury485 28/02/2021



<p>“If any of you is ever not feeling very well, just know that you can always feel free to contact any of us in private dm's or in the public discord server, whatever you want/need. We're here for anyone who needs us “ - The Dragon Warrior 08/05/2021

<h2>👿The Enemies of Pengu👿</h2>
<p>Likewise many have denied Pengu, and over months of existence, The P.A.C has made enemies which have attempted to halt us. These ventures were unsuccessful, but it is important to document all aspects of Pengu’s History, so here are The Enemies of Pengu:

<p>Kiwi Birbs - James_Browning, despite being a former Pengu Lover, started a counter trend to Pengu. It isn’t remotely as organised as The P.A.C, and only has one member, JB himself. He has attempted to persuade individuals to ditch Pengu and adopt Kiwi Birb - a stupid bird which is inferior to Penguins in every fashion. The Kiwi Birb Movement has been a failure, although it still is around and JB does seem to be getting better as a player.

<p>Egg and Vulpes Ovum - Qaxl and 1Riot started a group centred around a Fox called Egg. Their resistance to Pengu was strong, and P.A.C Officials tried to organise an event where we would find out who was superior once and for all. It would be Egg’s Best Players VS Pengu’s Best, a series of 4v4’s in all primary modes. Vulpes Ovum stopped communicating with P.A.C Officials, cancelling the event. Qaxl has essentially ditched the cause, and 1Riot has converted to [Adélie] Penguinism since then.

<p>Puffins - Worse, fake penguins, I don’t like them.

<p>Kelyplayz - The first ever Pengu Hater. Kely in the past has attempted to put down The Pengu Movement and Penguins as a whole by acting toxic towards individuals who supported it. He however was out-pvp’d by Pengu Supporters - causing him to amass members to counter attack The First few Incursions. These attacks failed as The Incursion remained strong, and now Kely has given up his resistance to Pengu.

<p>Thaash - I would identify this individual as the only genuinely toxic Pengu Hater, he takes Pengu extremely seriously and thus has acted with extremity towards The P.A.C. His most recent showup was during Incursion V, though he didn’t really do anything of note.

<p>Koipondfishing - Koipond is actually a great guy, I personally have VC’d with him, he’s the only Pengu Hater who has been invited to an Incursion as opposition. Nothing much to say besides his opposition in Pengu Incursions, and skill as a player.

<p>I am going to stress I do not want anybody, no matter who they are, to send any hate towards any of the mentioned individuals. Such actions are the pinnacle of stupidity, and The P.A.C condemns it. Thank you.

<h2>🔹The Five Arcs of Pengu🔹</h2>
<p>The Five Arcs of Pengu are simply fundamental guidelines which users of The P.A.C should follow. These were created to add some continuity to Pengu, and are not meant to be taken with cult-like dedication.

<p>1 Respect, and adore all kinds of penguins, as well as Pengu - whatever form it takes.

<p>2 Do not fight with fellow Pengu Supporters, at the end of the day we're all just people.

<p>3 Feck Puffins, I hate them >:I

<p>4 Be respectful to all, including those delusional enough to actively hate Pengu.

<p>5 Our end goal is to get Pengu The Penguin, in one of many incarnations, onto PVPLegacy's Lobby; and we want him to be locatable with a vanilla client.

<h2>🤔Here is why Pengu should be added to PVPLegacy🤔</h2>
<p>Now that you know everything you need to know about Pengu and The P.A.C, I am going to explain just why Pengu deserves to be built on PVPLegacy.

<p>Assuming The Admins built Pengu in a way similar to my newest designs, Pengu could be an objectively good fit to The PVPLegacy Map - regardless of biases towards or against us. It would simply be a cool looking statue with an audience of people who want it. Even Eni, PVPLegacy’s Builder, has admitted the design is good. It wouldn’t be pandering or giving in to construct Pengu, only something which adds to The Server’s Lobby.

<p>Given the magnitude of easter eggs and secret areas in PVPLegacy’s Map adding a Penguin Statue wouldn’t be difficult whatsoever. If Admins were able to make a UFO fly over OPKitPVP; create elaborate labyrinths; and an entire dungeon - building Pengu would be laughably easy and welcomed. AoElite has been given an opportunity to introduce a simple addition, which would not only be objectively good, but is easy to accomplish.

<p>In-addition, The P.A.C has received extraordinary amounts of support from PVPLegacy Veterans like Haphpint , Sythodeus and even Adrien, as well as from numerous new players. The notion that adding Pengu to VL would be too devissive is an incorrect one, as it's evident Pengu’s Cause is one that players not just within The P.A.C can get behind. This group most certainly isn’t made by new players who don’t understand the server’s history, Pengu’s Founders are easily some of the most understanding towards PVPLegacy’s past.

<p>Following on from this point, The P.A.C has a fairly large community surrounding it, so Pengu’s addition would garner positive reaction. It should be known that Pengu’s presence is not just in The P.A.C Discord, but in many other PVPLegacy Community Discords as well. Even if hypothetically Pengu wasn’t liked, people would simply be able to ignore its addition - as a new build on the server doesn’t obstruct anything relevant.

<p>For my final point, I would like to cite how The Pengu Incursions have made PVPLegacy History, and how The Admins are involved. Incursion IV in particular saw drastic admin interference, and with such a dramatic event being undergone I do wonder how Pengu still doesn’t qualify to be added? VL History was made, and with Eni making numerous statements on Pengu which seem to be hinting at, at least wanting for, something to be done with Pengu - it does seem fair to say The Admins themselves are interested in it. Ergo, it is fair for Pengu to be added, based on this argument alone.

<p>So as I have proven, there are plenty of absolutely valid arguments for Pengu’s Addition to PVPLegacy’s Lobby; but what about counter-arguments? Some say it doesn’t make sense for Pengu to be added, this can be rebutted with the variety of seemingly nonsensical easter eggs on VL like Donkeh. Others say it wouldn’t look good, or doesn’t fit - these people haven’t seen Pengu’s most recent designs.

<p>I could keep debunking false claims, but if this Guide has proven anything, it's that Pengu deserves to be implemented onto PVPLegacy.

<p>This has been a tiresome project to document important Pengu History, and also enlighten those unknowing about Pengu. Thanks all for reading, and please have a wonderful rest of your day!
